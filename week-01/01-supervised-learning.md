# Learning algorithms

## Supervised learning
It is a type of algorithm that uses a known dataset to make predictions.  
Supervised learning includes two categories of algorithms, **classification** and **regression**.

### Regression
It is for continuous-response values, e.g.: calculate the price of an house knowing a dataset of prices per square meter.

### Classification
It is for categorical response values, where the data can be separated into specific _partitions_, e.g.: predict if a tumor is malignant based on a dataset of tumors by size.

## Unsupervised learning
It is a technique for finding hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data.
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses.

Examples of its use are *google news*, where the news coming form different sources are clustered together by topic. Other examples are on *organizing computer clusters*, finding which machine can work better together, or *market segmentation*, trying to group the customers.
